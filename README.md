## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to put svg and change their settings in my code. I've never done that before. I just looked at the code and tried to change the height and fill for the color, and it worked!

```html
<svg height="1.5rem"><path fill="#f5faff"/></svg>
```

### Continued development

I want to perfect myself with SASS, I'm still new to this pre-processor, so I still have a lot to learn!

Thanks to everyone in the bootcamp I'm currently in with BeCode.org. I've learned a lot there, and that's why I was able to do this landing page on my own ðŸ˜Š.
